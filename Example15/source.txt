 There are innumerable details that were not specified in the description of the program, so
student’s answers may vary in many areas. The solution shown here contains three modules:
main.c obtains the command line argument and implements the transaction processing loop,
process.c implements the functions needed to decode and process the transactions, and io.c
implements the functions to open, read, write, and close the inventory file. Function prototypes
and other definitions needed by these modules are found in the associated header files.
There is an additional header file, part.h, which contains definitions relating to the structure that holds information about a part. typedefs are used to help ensure that variables are
declared with their proper types. This also makes it easier to change the type of a variable later
if the need arises. The declarations for TRUE and FALSE don’t really have anything to do with a

part, and appear in part.h only because there was no better place to put them. A larger program might have enough global definitions to justify putting them in a separate include file.
